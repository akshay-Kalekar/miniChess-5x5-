# Mini Chess 5x5

In this 5x5 chess variant, players use three distinct pieces: 'P,' which moves one block in any of the four cardinal directions; 'H1,' which moves in a plus pattern, skipping one block; and 'H2,' which moves diagonally, also skipping one block. This simplified yet strategic setup reimagines traditional chess tactics on a smaller board, encouraging fresh, dynamic gameplay.

## ℹ️ About the Project

This 5x5 chess variant offers a unique and streamlined experience, featuring only three distinct pieces that encourage strategic thinking on a compact board. The 'P' piece moves one block in any of the four cardinal directions, the 'H1' piece moves in a plus pattern, skipping one block, and the 'H2' piece moves diagonally, also skipping one block. These simplified moves and the reduced board size enhance tactical gameplay, making each move impactful.

Built with Next.js, the project leverages the framework's efficient server-side rendering and fast navigation to create a seamless user experience. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, offering a sleek, responsive design that enhances usability across devices. The Firebase Realtime Database powers the multiplayer functionality, allowing for smooth, real-time game state updates between players. Firebase’s robust, scalable backend also supports player synchronization, ensuring that each move is instantly reflected on both sides of the board, regardless of device.

This project exemplifies the integration of modern front-end technologies to create an engaging, multiplayer game with a unique twist on traditional chess mechanics, tailored to a minimalist 5x5 setup.
